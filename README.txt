I wrote this program for my JAVA_B class at Foothill College with was thought by professor Jesse Cecil.

The Game of Life  was invented by a mathematician, John Horton Conway.
“It was played by oneself in the spirit of solitaire.  One began with a large piece of graph paper and placed some marks or stones in a few of the squares to create an initial pattern or seed. After that, the rules of life determined what happened next. One referred to Conway's rules carefully examining each cell of the seed to figure out whether it survived, died or was reborn into the next generation. Thus, a series of generations resulted, each one arising by applying life's rules to the priorgeneration.  Conway's initial research demonstrated that there were certain seeds that caused things to get boring fast (the entire board became empty, i.e., all white/dead), while 	others generated interesting repetitive graphics: blinkers and gliders. He even offered a $50 prize to anyone who could prove or disprove that there was no finite initial condition that would grow without limit as the generations passed. … the rules are symbolic of a few crude observations that biologists have made about populations:  If things get either too crowded or too barren, individuals tend to die.  If they are in the sweet middle ground, they tend to survive.  And there is usually a special condition that creates birth.” (from our assignment).

For this assignment I wrote the program which get rule from user and then create automaton with this rule and single central seed. For example, when rule is “4” the seed will stay just one seed forever (you can see some examples of run the program at the end of .java file).
